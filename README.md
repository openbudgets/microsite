# OpenBudgets Microsite
This is an European Union project focused on giving EU municipalities a 
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution that will allow their citizens to 
visualize, interact and discuss about Budget and Spending of their towns, cities
and countries. 

## For Administrators
### Create users for municipalities
- To create a new user for a municipality, follow these steps:
  - Go to the administration site (http://\<your-url\>/admin)
  - Log in with admin credentials
  - Create User:
    - Click "Add" in the User section.
    - Add a name and password for the user.
    - Assign the user to a municipality:
        - Choose or create new municipality. This determines the content this 
          user has access to by filtering in the admin site according to his/her 
          municipality.
     - Save changes
  - Assign permissions to the user:
    - In the users lists, click on the user you just created
    - Under the "Permissions" section, tick the "Staff status" box. This will
      allow the user to access the administration site.
    - Under the "User permissions" subsection, add the following permissions 
      from the left box to the right box:
      - Add/change/delete Dataset
      - Add/change/delete Microsite
      - Add/change/delete Theme
    - Save changes.

## For Municipalities
### Workflow from zero to deploy
- First, create a Microsite and take note of the Microsite ID that is generated 
  for it. Enabling a Forum Platform here will enable discussion and 
  participation between citizens in your Microsite.
- Add as many Datasets as you want and link them to your Microsite.
- Set a layout for the microsite, which indicates how the datasets 
  are going to be drawn on screen and where should the discussion forum appear
- (optional) Add as many themes as you'd like and link them to your Microsite.
- (optional) Go to your Microsite detail page and select the theme you like the 
  most.
- Go to http://HOST_URL/vizmanager/{Microsite ID} to see your Microsite being 
  rendered

### Important
- The **code** field of a Dataset in the administration site has to be set to
  the code you get from OpenSpending when you upload the dataset there.
  <br>
  E.g., if you can see your dataset here: 
  ```
  http://next.openspending.org/viewer/23cdc48554ae8648deff7837c025d8c0:kpai2016
  ```
  Then your Dataset's code is:
  ```
  23cdc48554ae8648deff7837c025d8c0:kpai2016
  ```
  <b>With the dataset-selection widget it should be as easy as inserting part of 
  the dataset name in the field and selecting it from the suggestions that will 
  appear as the system recognises your dataset.<b>

## For Developers / DevOps
This project uses Python3, Django and AngularJS 1.x.
<br> 
Familiarity with those is advised.

### Run locally
```bash
$ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 manage.py migrate
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```

### Run on Docker Compose
Configure environment variables inside docker-compose.yml and then run:
```bash
$ docker-compose up
```
The backend administration server should be reachable at 
http://localhost:8000/admin and the frontend for each microsite should be at
 http://localhost:8000/vizmanager/{Microsite ID}

### Important
- If you're using a remote version of OS-Viewer, your themes won't be available 
  on microsites; the idea for that functionality to work is to use a local 
  installation or a docker container of OS-Viewer. That way, you can share 
  volumes to get the os_viewer_themes folder shared between OS-Viewre and this 
  project.
- Disqus' guest comments are automatically flagged to be pre-moderated, so if 
  there are users commenting without an account, this will require a moderator 
  to approve their comments.
